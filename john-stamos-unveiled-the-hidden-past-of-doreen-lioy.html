Ramirez was ultimately responsible for the deaths of at least 14 people. He also raped and tortured dozens more people until being apprehended in 1985. In 1996, he married Lioy.</p><p>Recent developments, however, have revealed a different side to the serial killer’s widow.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Entertainment Tonight in 2019, veteran actor John Stamos claimed that he was trained by Lioy before landing his big break at General Hospital in 1982.</p><h2><span id=The_revelation_made_by_John_Stamos>The revelation made by John Stamos</span></h2><p>According to the 2019 story, <strong>Stamos met Lioy when he was 16 or 17 years old through a friend, Michael Damian.</strong> Given that Stamos was born on August 19, 1963, their first meeting can be dated to the late 1970s – at least half a decade before Lioy began courting the legendary killer.</p><p>Lioy worked as an editor for Tiger Beat magazine, a popular teen fan publication at the time. She became interested in the young Stamos and was even the first to profile him in the magazine. The now-famous actor first appeared in the editor’s section in a portrait with Lioy before becoming a cover staple.</p><p>Not only that, but Stamos said that the serial killer’s widow prepped him for his breakthrough role in General Hospital.</p><p>The portrayal earned the actor a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the Daytime Emmy Awards. The actor and Lioy became closer as the events unfolded, and the two became nearly family.</p><p>[Lioy] was like a sister to me, and she became great friends with my mother – she was a very lonely woman – and spent all of our holidays with us.</p><h2><span id=The_same_words_were_used_to_describe_John_Stamos_and_her_husband_by_Doreen_Lioy>The same words were used to describe John Stamos and her husband by Doreen Lioy</span></h2><p>What surprised Stamos the most was that Lioy used the same compliments to describe Ramirez as she had previously used to describe him.</p><p>Lioy spoke to CNN many years before the famed killer’s death about the influence he left on her. No, she didn’t see a cold-blooded killer! She described him as a wonderful person who became her best friend.</p><p>He [Richard Ramirez] is nice, witty, and appealing…</p><p>I think he’s a wonderful person. He’s my best pal; he’s my pal.</p><p>Stamos’ family severed contact with Lioy after her association with the serial killer became public. Lioy has been missing since the death of Richard Ramirez, therefore her whereabouts are unknown.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":301440,"10":2,"11":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"15":"Arial","18":1,"21":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>magazine editor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Facts About Pete Lee’s Girlfriend Nikki Schmidtmann</a></h3>Funnyman Pete Lee wishes to inform his social media followers that he is happily in love!

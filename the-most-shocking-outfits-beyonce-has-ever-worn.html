So, when they ultimately did in 2011, you best believe it was a grand event! Dressed in a now-iconic sequinned&nbsp;Dolce & Gabbana jacket, Beyoncé took to the MTV Video Music Awards stage to perform “Love on Top”&nbsp;(per MTV). And, right before breaking into song, she confirmed she was pregnant with her first child by saying, “I want you to feel the love that’s growing inside of me.” She ended the number by unbuttoning her tux jacket and&nbsp;memorably stroking her baby bump.&nbsp;</p><p>The moment is one for the books, having tectonically shaken up records at the time.&nbsp;Guinness World Records noted that, after the performance, Twitter documented a sharp spike in activity with&nbsp;a record-breaking 8,868 tweets sent per second. As it turns out, there’s a rather “stressful” story behind Beyoncé’s outfit that night, as recalled by her mother, Tina Knowles, in an Instagram post 10 years after the performance.</p><p>Two hours before Beyoncé went on stage, Knowles had to rush to a maternity shop since&nbsp;the pants she initially had made for her daughter&nbsp;were “too tight.” “I bought two sizes in maternity pants but wound up taking the panel off of one of them and putting it in the ones that I had made!” she wrote. “Thank God it worked.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaeq670q1krKCfmLiqusZmpq6slp7BtHnBnrCoppOaeqmt0macr52iYsSwvs1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

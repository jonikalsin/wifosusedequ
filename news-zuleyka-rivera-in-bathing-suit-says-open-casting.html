Read on to see 6 ways Zuleyka Rivera stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/zuleykarivera_274872311_2152355108260708_4388655352895276406_n.jpg><p><span>Zuleyka once revealed to the AP that eating multiple times a day helps her stay fit. "I eat very well," she said. "My nutritionist ordered me to eat six times a day." Include protein in each. "</span><span>Plant-based protein powders are a low-sugar, high-fiber alternative to popular dairy-based supplements. A study by the University of Tampa that compared plant protein to whey found it to be equally as effective at changing body composition and boosting muscle recovery and growth. But with less sugar and a healthier fat profile, plant-based proteins will also improve your gut health at the same time as they're fueling your muscles. Hemp, rice, and pea proteins are all good options; however, you'll want to ensure you're getting a complete protein with a full amino acid profile, which is why a blend that combines all three is superior."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-960918248.jpg><p><span>If you want a six-pack like Zuleyka, hit the gym.

One of her go-tos? Running. "Research has shown that exercise is not only good for your physical health, it also supports emotional and mental health. You can exercise with a friend and get the added benefit of emotional support. So, next time you're feeling down, anxious, or stressed, try to get up and start moving!" says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>National Institute on Aging</span></a><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-911521708.jpg><p><span>Zuleyka also boxes.

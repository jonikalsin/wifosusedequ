As of 2022, Paul McCartney’s net worth is $1.2 million. He gained fame for being the bassist, co-songwriter, and co-lead vocalist for the Beatles.</p><p>Known for his melodious bass playing, broad tenor vocal range, and musical eclecticism spanning from pre-rock ‘n’ roll pop to classical and electronica, he is one of the most popular songwriters and performers in history. In the history of songwriting, he and John Lennon have been the most successful.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Paul_McCartney_WikiBiography></span><span id=Paul_McCartney_WikiBiography>Paul McCartney Wiki/Biography</span> <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born on 18 June 1942, Paul McCartney’s age is 80 Years Old as of 2022. He was born and raised in a lower-middle-class Roman Catholic family in Liverpool, England.

His father had an upright piano in the living room, and he encouraged his boys to learn to play the instrument.</p><p>When it came to learning, he wanted to do it the old-fashioned way. Despite his father’s encouragement, when he was 11 years old, he tried out for the Liverpool Cathedral choir but was rejected. He subsequently became a member of the choir at St. Barnabas’ Church, Mossley Hill, after that. When rock and roll became popular on Luxembourg’s national radio station, he swapped in his nickel-plated trumpet for a £15 Framus Zenith (type 17) acoustic guitar so he could sing along with the music.</p><p>He later enrolled himself at the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school. Of the ninety pupils who took the 11-Plus test that year, he was the only survivor. This allowed him entry to the Liverpool Institute, which was a traditional grammar school. He met George Harrison, a fellow Speke High School student, on the bus in 1954. The two became fast friends after the meeting.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Paul McCartney</td></tr><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Sir James Paul McCartney</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>18 June 1942</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>80 Years Old</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Liverpool, England</td></tr><tr><td>Currently Live In</td><td>Wood, London</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Songwriter and Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Debut</td><td><strong>TV Series:</strong> Ready Steady Go!

Hannay & Co., a cotton merchant in Napier, New Zealand; when the war broke out, Hannay’s was shut down and Jim was hired as a lathe turner at Napier’s defense engineering works, volunteering for the fire brigade at night. In 1944, a Knowsley apartment was found for the expanding family, and in 1946, they moved to a municipal housing estate in Speke.

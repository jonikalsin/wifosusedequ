Plus, a new report sheds new light on what Jackie’s role next season may look like.</p><p>“I don’t know that my role is diminished, but if it is, you have to believe that the universe put you in that position to raise awareness about something, and then put you on a path to continue raising awareness,” Jackie told <a href=# rel=noopener>Page Six</a>. “No matter what, I show up. I’m filming all the time no matter what you want to call me, so whatever Bravo decides to call me, I’m here and doing the same thing, so it makes no difference to me.”</p><p>On The Morning Toast in May, Frank fueled rumors of Jackie’s demotion, saying, “Yes, I heard yes, she is a friend of.”</p><p>Looking back on his comment, Jackie said she’s not upset with the “lovable” Frank.</p><p>“There’s nothing that Frank could do that could make me not love Frank,” she noted. “Bravo makes those decisions and Bravo has not made any decisions yet.”</p><p>As Jackie focuses on the making of her first book and attempts to get her podcast off the ground, she says she’s planning “to be on the show for a long time” and hopes to continue to raise awareness about <a href=# rel=noopener>eating disorders</a>.</p><p>“[My recovery is] going well,” Jackie confirmed. But, she continued,&nbsp;it’s “not as easy as I thought it was” going to be.</p><p>“I thought I would just start eating more and everything would come together but there’s been a lot of hurdles for me, so I’m definitely, like, well on my way, a thousand times better than I was last year, but I do have issues,” she admitted. “None of my clothes fit me anymore. You know, that’s a lot for me. That’s been really hard for me – is not feeling good about myself and I have to take a step back and realize what I’m doing for my health and how much more important that is, but I’ve come a long way and I’ve got a long way to go.”</p><p>As she continues to recover, Jackie said husband&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Evan Goldschneider</strong></a> has been “a gift.”</p><p>“He is, like, the most supportive husband ever,” she gushed. “Sometimes I’ll be talking to him about things, and I’ll say, ‘Sorry I’m putting all of this on you now,’ because for 18 years, I didn’t put any of this on him. I wouldn’t talk to him about anything having to do with weight or body image, and now, it’s like, he always says to me, it never bothers me, I’m so happy to be here for you. He’s just the best.”</p><p>Amid the speculation,&nbsp;Deux Moi&nbsp;shared a tip on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, which seemed to be about Jackie.</p><p>“This east coast [housewife] that was supposed to be demoted has brought so much drama to filming that producers may have no choice but keep her on the ensemble. This will not make <a href=# rel=noopener>a certain costar</a> happy at ALL,” the tip teased.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jackie-Goldschneider-Reportedly-Not-Demoted-Ahead-of-Season-13.jpg http: alt="RHONJ Jackie Goldschneider Reportedly Not Demoted Ahead of Season 13" width=500 height=392 title="Jackie Goldschneider Reportedly Not Demoted Ahead of Season 13" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p></p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey <a href=# rel=noopener>season 13</a> will likely begin airing on Bravo very late this year or early next year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpiku6t50q2Yq2WalrCstcRmnqiklKiwqbrEopueql2WsaW%2BxKyqnqtdmbKuu9Oipqdloqq6sL7SaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

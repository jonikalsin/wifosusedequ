In the first verse, he talks about a girl who ignored him when he had no money, but now wants him because of his wealth. He also mentions his success in the drug trade and how he and his crew "get them racks like Serena." UZI also talks about his "happy place" and the consumption of drugs like G6 and Percocet. He boasts about his sexual prowess and ability to make women "percolate" and give him head. He also mentions his expensive Rollie watch, and how he used to be laughed at but now people bring their business ideas to him.</p><br><p>The verse concludes with the repeated phrase "Free Uzi," a reference to his legal troubles with his record label that prevented him from releasing new music. In the second verse, he continues to boast about his wealth, claiming to make women want to "flock" with him and referencing his Wonton brand. UZI also talks about his enemies and how his crew will not hesitate to retaliate if they are threatened. He ends the verse by discussing his love for The Big Bang Theory and reiterating that he is still a millionaire despite any setbacks he may have faced.</p><br><p>This song showcases UZI's typical style of explicit lyrics and braggadocious demeanor. It also highlights his legal battle with his record label that prevented him from releasing music for a time. Despite the controversy, UZI remains a popular and successful rapper with a devoted fanbase.<br></p><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Symere Woods</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maISZoayWxsiYrZ6qpGSTs7HEmIyzoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

[But] she is an independent woman doing her thing. I respect any women that does her thing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Michael went on to say, “I met Kim on Beyond The Break,” the&nbsp;show he previously starred on. “It was great meeting up with her and [the family].”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>It turns out Michael did know a few members of the Kardashian klan prior to meeting Kim. “I do know the family — I have known <strong>Khloe</strong> for about 11 years,” Michael said. “I met Khloe through the Disney crowd.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite going on a date with Kim last week, the whole fling seems to be set up or staged. Michael has other obligations in NYC that he seemed much more concerned about. “I am in NYC producing a movie called Killer Holiday,” he said, “And also working on some music.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Poor Kim! This means she’s still on the market, but that could be good news for all the bankers in NYC rumored to be trying to hunt her down for a date — and even better if she’s actually trying to work out things with her ex <strong>Reggie Bush!</strong></p><h3>– Lindsey DiMattina, reporting by Mike Paffmann</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlgZH5xe5BsZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjwG65yJyfmp2cYrCwvM6nZKenpGKxosDIp55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

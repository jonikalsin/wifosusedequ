She expressed worry about how the water used in the event may be reallocated to help with the drought.</p><p>The much-anticipated Water Bomb event is a summer music festival with a splash theme. The event’s attractions include water cannon battles and water sprays, as well as concerts by different musicians. The event is gaining popularity this year because of a star-studded roster that includes MAMAMOO Hwasa, EXO Kai, ZICO, Jay Park, Jessi, Simon Dominic, Loco, and more.&nbsp;The Seoul edition of the event will take place at Jamsil Stadium in Seoul, and it promises water gun fights and a swimming pool party. However, the period this year corresponds with the winter drought, which has lasted far into the summer.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>WATERBOMB FESTIVAL SEOUL 2022 LINEUP<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#CL</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#씨엘</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@chaelinCL</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0fb8ul7T7p</a></p><p>— 𝓵𝓮𝓮 𝓬𝓱𝓪𝓮𝓻𝓲𝓷 ♡ (@lchaerinvids) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2022</a></p><h2>PSY’s statements regarding water use in his summer performances prompted Lee El’s statement.</h2><p>Lee El announced the event on June 12th, noting that the city could make better use of all the water utilized during the festival. She said that the concert would use more than 300 tonnes of water.</p><p>Lee El said,</p><p>“I want the 300t of water from the Water Bomb performance may be sprayed over the Soyang River.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lee-El-2.jpg alt="Lee El" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This statement seems to be in response to one of PSY’s previous remarks. During his visit to MBC’s Radio Star, the K-Pop megastar recently sparked controversy.&nbsp;On May 4th, the artist discussed his water-soaked summer performance, which was momentarily canceled because of the epidemic. He disclosed that the water used in the event was safe to drink. PSY said,</p><p>“I use potable water. Water is quite costly. It costs around 300 tons every concert.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Water scarcity is one of the biggest issues that humanity faces and Psy wants to use 300 tons in each of his concerts 🤦🏽‍♀️ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Xs8eO1g0UF</a></p><p>— PlayGround + (@PlayGroundPlus) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 13, 2022</a></p><p>This comment prompted debate, with some Korean individuals pointing out that squandering that much water during a severe drought season would have negative consequences. Many others advocated for the use of agricultural water instead.&nbsp;PSY’s summer performances are infamous for excessive water consumption since the premise of his presentation is to spray water from all sides during the performance, immersing the crowd.</p><p>In light of this, Korean netizens have greeted Lee El’s latest remarks as much-needed fury.&nbsp;However, a certain segment of the audience chastised the actor, claiming that as long as the concertgoers had bought the water, it was OK to use it for festivals.</p><p>This prompted the actor to issue another tweet, saying:</p><p>“Fine. If you’re furious, express yourself, and if you want to cuss, curse. Yes. Because we all think differently as humans.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lee-El-3.jpg alt="Lee El" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The winter drought in South Korea is expected to last until the spring and early summer, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration. This month’s total precipitation was just 5.8mm, accounting for only 5.6 percent of the typical monthly total of 104.2mm. Because of the extreme drought, the Soyang River’s headwaters had already dried up, proving Lee El’s statement correct.&nbsp;Lee El’s declaration comes just weeks after the conclusion of the smash drama My Liberation Notes, in which she co-stars with Son Seok-Koo, Kim Ji-won, and Lee Min-ki.&nbsp;The 39-year-old South Korean beauty plays Yeom Ki Jung, the oldest of three siblings, in the drama.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijnp1dmrlusdepqZ6ro5rAbq%2FOp5qeqp5irqO71K1ksJmkmr9ur86nqq6loKm2sLqMnayroZ6cerW0xGaumqyVp3qju8ybZJ%2Bdo6m2t63LaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

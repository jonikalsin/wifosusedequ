The stunning actress was in New Orleans filming scenes for her highly anticipated new movie, Mona Lisa And The Blood Moon, on July 2, when she showed off her post-baby body in a tiny crop top. Kate showed off her new figure in a white mesh top, which was completely see-through, and cut off on the bottom to make it cropped, showing off her entirely bare stomach. Underneath the transparent fishnet top, Kate showed off a halterneck triangle bikini top. She styled the shirt with a pair of bright red low-rise Soffe shorts, folding the elastic band over around her tiny waist. Completing her look were a pair of hot pink platform flip flops, while a ton of temporary tattoos covered her body.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Kate has always had a fabulous figure, and fitness means everything to the actress, who even started her own workout clothing brand, <strong>Fabletics</strong>. Back in April, Kate revealed that she was almost at her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“goal weight,”</a> and three months later, the actress looks pretty damn good. To get to her goal weight, Kate joined <strong>WW</strong>, which was formerly Weight Watchers, as an ambassador. Since joining, the star looks better than ever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Kate took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on April 18, to share her journey with getting back in shape after giving birth, “Okay my friends, wanted to share! I’m a couple lbs from goal weight! I’ve done it without stressing on food or working out like crazy although I have been disciplined.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kate-hudson-post-baby-belly-embed1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kate-hudson-post-baby-belly-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>She continued the post, writing, “I’ve taken my time, I’ve stayed true to my WW app, which I am so grateful for our relationship and that they included me in their family, because it’s an incredible set up. Easy as pie! And I can eat pie… except it’s anywhere from 9-22 points which is not the best move… I personally go for the 5 point wine or vodka martini for a treat, I digress.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH14e49sZqSZpJp6qcHDrKanZZOnvLF506inZqifqMFursCbsGaan5nGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

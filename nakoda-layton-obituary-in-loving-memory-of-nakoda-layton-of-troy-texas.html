As I look at the presents under the tree there are none for you. I didn’t order you a birthday cake. I didn’t buy a 19 birthday candle. It’s not fair. You loved Christmas, the lights, shopping, wrapping presents and now I’m here doing it by myself without you. I was crying the other day just because I was making sausage for biscuits and sausage gravy. You loved that. I miss your shit eaten grin, the way you would wave when pulling out of the drive way, the way you were always cold just like me – then there was Noah in shorts and a shirt when it’s 40 degrees. You are in our every thought of everyday. We miss you and Kayleigh ,” a Facebook post said.</p><p>Words fall short of expressing our grief for your loss, as we mourn with family and friends for this great loss. We are truly sorry to hear of the loss of this promising being. Please accept our condolences and may our prayers help comfort you.

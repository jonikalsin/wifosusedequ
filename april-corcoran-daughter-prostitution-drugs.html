Willingham had sex with the daughter repeatedly, often filming the act. Corcoran, for her part, sometimes took steps to make her daughter appear even younger than 11 in order to satisfy Willingham’s sexual penchant for very young children.</p><p>After the sex acts were completed, prosecutors allege that Corcoran would praise and reward her daughter in a way that’s truly, fittingly sickening:</p><p>“Sometimes this defendant would give a little bit of heroin to her daughter,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Katie Pridemore. “The daughter didn’t want it but she said, ‘You’re a good girl, you did the right thing.'”</p><p>While Willingham still faces charges of rape, gross sexual imposition, pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, and human trafficking, Corcoran has now plead guilty.</p><p>“She wanted to take responsibility for her actions and she doesn’t want to put her daughter through any further trauma,” said defense attorney James Bogen.</p><p>Now, authorities say the daughter lives with her father out of state. Corcoran will face sentencing on July 19, at which time she could very well be put in prison for the rest of her life.</p><p>Next, watch a <a href=#>video proving that everything you know about drug addiction is wrong</a>.

The American football quarterback has never been married before, and so does not have a wife. However, he has a girlfriend whose name is Jenna Brandt. The two have been officially in a relationship since November 2022.</strong></p><p>Brock Purdy in 2022 did not only land the starting quarterback job for the 49ers but also made things official with his girlfriend, Jenna Brandt. Considering his success, fame, and accomplishments in the NFL, many people have been left curious about what his personal life outside the courts looks like. Among other areas of his personal life, Purdy’s fans are most especially inquisitive about his love life.</p><h2><strong>Is Brock Purdy Married?</strong></h2><p>While some people wonder if he is married and who his wife is, others are occupied with finding out if he is dating anyone and who his girlfriend is. As a matter of fact, Brock Purdy is not married and has never been married before; therefore, he does not have a wife or an ex-wife. The questions about his marital and love life come up because he has been keeping his personal life private since he rose to fame.</p><p>However, it became public knowledge in November 2022 that Brock Purdy is dating Jenna Brand. Although this is the first time the duo revealed their relationship to the public, it is widely believed that they had been dating long before then. In any way, below is what we know about the woman that won the hearts of the San Francisco 49ers maestro.</p><p>Meanwhile, notable is the fact that Jenna is Purdy’s first publicly known relationship. The San Francisco 49ers quarterback has, since his rise to fame, never publicly dated, been linked with any woman, or showcased any woman as his love interest. So this is the reason many people give attention to his believable first relationship.</p><h2><strong>Who is Brock Purdy’s Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Brock Purdy’s Girlfriend is Jenna Brandt. She was born on the 26th of October 1999 in Sumner, Iowa, United States. Jenna is currently 24 years old, which means she shares the same birth year with her boyfriend Brock but a different date and month. Her zodiac sign is Scorpio. She has three siblings with whom she grew up; Kaylyn, Isaiah, and Morgan Brandt.</p><p>Jenna was raised by her parents, Amy and Kevin Brandt, in Summer, Iowa, United States. She is an American national and belongs to the white ethnicity. She currently resides with her family in San Francisco, California, United States. Jenna comes from a close-knit family that mostly features on her Instagram page. She once said that spending time with her siblings and parents is one of her favorite things to do.</p><h3><strong>Purdy’s Girlfriend is also a Star Athlete</strong></h3><p>Jenna Brandt attended Sumner-Fredericksburg High School, and there, she played on the volleyball team for four years and served as a two-time team volleyball team captain. She also competed in field and track and played on a club volleyball team. Upon graduating in 2018, Jenna moved to Iowa State University’s volleyball team and later proceeded to the University of Northern Iowa, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree.</p><p>Throughout her college years, Jenna Brandt continued with her volleyball career. She played as a setter for the Iowa State Cyclones and was a three-year starter and a four-letter winner. Between 2018 and 2020, she tried out for the USA Women’s Volleyball National Team fold and the U.S. Collegiate National Team.</p><p>Jenna played for three seasons with the Cyclones, including a trip to South America, where she competed with international teams. She announced her plan to transfer to the University of Northern Iowa in late 2020, expressing that she was thankful for the experiences, opportunities, and friendships she made at Iowa State.</p><p>In 2022, Jenny Brandt wrapped up her volleyball career and called it a “dream come true.” Since then, it has not been revealed what Brandt has been up to in terms of her professional life. Regardless, her exit from playing volleyball apparently did not stop her love life from blossoming.</p><h2><strong>Brock Purdy and Brandt Have Been Together Since Their College Days</strong></h2><p>Brock Purdy and Jenna Brandt reportedly met during their college days. The duo enrolled in Iowa State University in 2018 as student-athletes. While Jenna was a setter for the volleyball team, Brock Purdy spent most of his time on the football field. So, even though they might have known each other then, they didn’t get to spend time together.</p><p>Moreover, Jenna eventually transferred to the University of Northern Iowa in 2021. But, from what is perceivable, the duo kept in touch and ended up falling in love with each other. They unofficially made their first public and social media appearances during the summer of 2022, making their fans more curious about what they are up to.</p><p>The couple in the same year, precisely on 4th November 2022, went Instagram official with their relationship. Jenna took to her Instagram page with a series of photos that featured herself, Purdy, and her family spending time together on a farm. Alongside the slideshow, Jenna wrote, “My roots and my boy”. This announcement seemed to have made their fans elated and settled that their favorites have now found the love of their lives.</p><p>Significantly, Purdy also revealed that he has already introduced Brandt to his family, including his parents, Shawn and Carrie Purdy, and siblings. Meanwhile, it was later found out that even before they went Instagram official, Brandt had once hung out with Purdy’s family in July 2022 while they attended a Morgan Wallen concert together, and his sister Whitney posted their group photo on her Instagram page.</p><h3><strong>Jenna Brandt is Very Supportive of Her Boyfriend’s Career</strong></h3><p>Since they made their relationship official, the couple, especially Jenna, has posted several photos of themselves on social media spending time together. She has also been spotted several times with Purdy’s family at 49ers games and ringing in the New Year together.</p><p>Brandt is very supportive of Purdy’s NFL career and said that she is his biggest fan and his number one cheerleader. It is admitted that Jenna Brandt first rose to fame as a volleyball player, but her fame unarguably skyrocketed after revealing her relationship with Purdy.</p><p>Brandt is always at the 49ers game to cheer her man up. As a fellow athlete, it is evident that she understands what it takes to be one. Her Instagram page is filled with striking photos of her showing off as Purdy’s fan, some of which show where she is kissing Pury over victories he made. They do not have any children together yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmoqtdl7%2Bwr8pmp66qlK56rq3Rq6CenF2Wu6V5w6icrGWYmnqprdWeZJplp56zpnnOq2SgoaKhs7O1xKebaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

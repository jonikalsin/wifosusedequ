Aside from his singing career, Jaechan has been in a number of various programs and web dramas, the most recent of which being Watcha’s Semantic Error.</p><h2>This is the second time DONGKIZ’s Jaechan has been accused of bullying at school.</h2><p>In a Twitter thread, the idol was called out for suspected bullying in school. An anonymous netizen (hence referred to as Netizen A) stated that Jaechan had only targeted female students. A stated:</p><p>“Park Jae Chan, who portrayed Choo Sang Woo in Semantic Error, was a school bully. Since elementary school, he has solely bullied female students. He would irritate other kids with his bully squad, and he smoked in class. You know the truth before you like him.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jaechan-2.jpg alt=Jaechan width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Netizen A also shared images of the idol’s graduation as confirmation of their allegation.&nbsp;The anonymous complainant further stated that Jaechan had a negative impression of idol fans until he became a trainee himself.</p><p>“He used to call idol fans pitiful and disparage all male idols until he became one of the trainees in ninth grade. As a result, we used to remark that labels are unconcerned with the past. If you have a screenshot showing him smoking and carrying a random wood beam that he posted on social media, please share it.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>220314 Translated Announcement <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#DONGKIZ</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#동키즈</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/sf9pkqAYKG</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VlngKxoof5</a></p><p>— 별 ✨ (@DKZCOM) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2022</a></p><p>Other Twitter users verified Netizen A’s statements.

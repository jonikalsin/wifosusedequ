She is accused of soliciting a capital offense, first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and child abuse. The same accusations are made against her now-husband Mario Fernandez Saldana.</p><p>“For 547 days we hoped and prayed that this day would come,” said Kristen Bridegan, the widow of the late Christopher Bridegan, whose story was this week’s focus of “Dr. Phil” once more. “With the arrest of Shanna, we have closed one horrific chapter in our quest for justice for Jared and begun a new one.”</p><p>However, according to an arrest warrant, “the investigation into Bridegan’s background revealed a highly contentious divorce from his ex-wife, Shanna Gardner, and a contentious relationship with both Gardner and Fernandez Saldana.” Authorities have not yet discovered their reason.</p><p>Saldana was detained on the same day Nelson revealed that Henry Arthur Tenon, 62, admitted to being the triggerman in the killing and had pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. On January 25, he was the first to be charged in the case.</p><p>Nelson vowed that until the truth was revealed, her office and law enforcement would not back down.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_being_charged_How_was_Bridegan_put_to_death></span><strong>What is being charged? How was Bridegan put to death?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After dropping off twin children at Mario and Shanna’s Jacksonville Beach residence on February 16, 2022, Bridegan was shot. Fernandez Saldana and Tenon are suspected of planning the crime.</p><p>With his 2-year-old daughter in the car, Bridegan was traveling back to St. Augustine, Florida, when he stopped on Sanctuary Road due to a flat tire. Police initially stated that they didn’t believe the tire on the road was the result of an accident. Bridegan frequently used this residential street to travel to Butler Boulevard. He put on his warning lights, got out of the car to relocate the tire, and was shot dead right away, according to the police. Nothing seemed to have been stolen, and the toddler was unhurt in her car seat.</p><p>In 2018, Fernandez Saldana wed Gardner, whose parents recently revealed that they haven’t spoken in a while. After the case received extensive media notice, Gardner and her children relocated to Washington State. In June, Gardner said she wanted people to understand her perspective given the publicity.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Chris Peluso Wikipedia, Wiki, Wife, Cause of Death, Obituary, Hockey</a></li><li><a href=#>Mary Steenburgen Diet, Wikipedia, Wiki, Christmas Movie, Who Is, Head Injury, Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=#>David Archuleta Ethnicity, Wikipedia, Wiki, Dating, Crush, Sexuality, Instagram</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtoq5iWu6%2BtjKCYq5yemr9ussSrpZqmlJrHcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Kennedy Sr.</a> and Rose Kennedy. Joseph's business dealings helped amass the Kennedy family fortune and launch the family's political career, which first started when he became the inaugural chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and then the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 until late 1940.</p><p>Joseph and Rose had nine children together, starting with Joseph Jr., who died in World War II during a top secret mission. John was the second eldest and would go on to become U.S. president. Next came Rose Marie, whose father -- fearful that her mood swings might embarrass the family -- ordered that she have a lobotomy at 23 years old, which reduced her mental capacity to that of a two-year-old.</p><p>Next came three sisters: Kathleen, who died in a plane crash in 1948; Eunice, who started the Special Olympics in Rosemary Kennedy's honor; and Patricia, whom her father <a href=# rel=noopener>described</a> as "the one with head for business. She could really run this town if she put her mind to it." Unfortunately, that was never to be, given the misogyny of the time.</p><p>Lastly, there was Robert, the senator and U.S. attorney general who was assassinated not long after his elder brother; Jean, a former U.S. ambassador to Ireland and the Kennedy family's last surviving child; and Edward, a longtime U.S. senator who died in office in 2009.</p><p>The photos above shows this family in their prime, before the Kennedy Curse came to take so many of them away.</p><p>Fascinated by these Kennedy family photos?

The superstar producer took to Twitter in late December and <a href=# rel=noopener>responded to a fan who brought up the tension between him and the 6 God</a>.</p><p>“Are u and Drake seriously beefing or is it not that deep?” one social media asked the producer, to which he replied:&nbsp;“Not deep at all lmao.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The drama between the two began earlier in December, when Metro weighed in on a debate about the streaming figures of his Heroes & Villains versus Drake and <a href=#>21 Savage</a>’s <a class=underline-link href=#>Her Loss</a>.</p><p>After an account reported that the Missouri native’s LP has amassed more streams in a single year (3.7 billion) than any other rap album since 2018 and is currently generating more than twice the amount of daily streams as Her Loss, he wrote in a since-deleted post: “Yet Her Loss keeps winning rap album of the year over H&V.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/01/metro-boomin-drake-heroes-villains-250x142.png alt="Metro Boomin Explains Why Drake Was Left Off 'Heroes & Villains' Album" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Metro Boomin Explains Why Drake Was Left Off 'Heroes & Villains' Album</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>January 19, 2023</p></a><p>He added: “Proof that award shows are just politics and not for me. Idc about awards honestly, the true award and REWARD is knowing that the music I spend so much time on brings joy to people’s everyday lives.”</p><p>Drake then appeared to fire back at Metro on his Instagram Stories by quoting the <a href=#>JAY-Z</a> song “Heart of the City (Ain’t No Love),” sharing the bars: “Damn, little mans, I’m just tryin’ to do me/ If the record’s two mil, I’m just tryin’ to move three.”</p><p>Shortly thereafter, <a class=underline-link href=#>he also unfollowed Metro on Instagram</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>A little later, during a livestream on Stake, <a class=underline-link href=#>the “hotline Bing” hitmaker said: “To the rest of you — the non-believers, the underachievers, the tweet and deleters</a> — you guys make me sick to my stomach, fam.”</p><p>The trap beatmaker, who many assumed was the target, <a class=underline-link href=#>seemingly responded on Twitter</a> by posting the <a href=# rel=noopener>viral meme video featuring an argument between a group of Black people and racist white folks</a> (played by Black actors) on a basketball court. In the clip, one of the “white” actors mockingly says to his Black opponent: “Whoa calm down Jamal, don’t pull out the 9.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibq5mbmnq0vM6toJ%2BxXZ22qLTErKtmq6SnsqK5xJ1kq5mgpbKzeZFpaWxlnZrBs7uMm6aopZmjeqK4wa6k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

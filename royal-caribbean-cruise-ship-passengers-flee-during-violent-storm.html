No announcement from the captain before or after, also no mention of what happened. Just pretend like it didn’t happen I guess,”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> TikTok user Lucassparrow1110 posted</a>.</p><p>Sparrow also posted harrowing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">footage on Twitter</a> of chairs and umbrellas flying on the ship as screaming passengers seek cover from the storm — and several people are seen sliding across a windswept walkway.</p><p>“Instead of telling people to come up to the top deck when we have a severe thunderstorm warning, maybe you should be more worried about your guests and employees and tell them to get inside,” he wrote.</p><p>At one point, a lounge chair narrowly misses a woman carrying a child.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized">The Royal Caribbean cruise ship Independence of the Seas was struck by a freak storm. <span class=credit>lucassparrow1110</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Passengers were seen on video running for their lives. <span class=credit>lucassparrow1110</span></figure><p>Jenn Stancil, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">captured footage of the storm</a> moving in, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Fox 35 Orlando</a>: “It just turned crazy.

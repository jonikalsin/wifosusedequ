It stated, “Over decades, research has demonstrated that abortion bans most severely impact people in marginalized groups who already struggle to access health care, including abortion.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Medical abortions versus surgical abortions</h2><p>Abortions can either be surgical or medical.

However, Korlym has a larger dose of mifepristone and isn't recommended for abortions.

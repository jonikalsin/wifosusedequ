He's not drinking, he's not having any caffeine," Piers ranted. "He's like a robot."</p><p>A clip of Harry's presentation was aired subsequently, at which Piers laughed profusely. "Yeah Harry really wrote this," Piers scoffed.</p><p>Before starting is speech, Harry walked towards the side of the stage where Meghan was standing out of view and led her to the spotlight, sending the audience in a frenzy.</p><p>While Meghan didn't speak at the gathering, Harry said, "Guys I am with you, and we are with you. Get to work."</p><p>However, Morgan wasn't particularly impressed by the heartwarming moment. "I grew up around very strong women - this kind of guff, they didn't need it," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqJmav7R5zKipoJmeYr%2BqvNJmp6uhnpiybrTAq6myZaGqtrXAyKeeZpmcmLypu8tmmpqelp6yr7GMm6OapZWoeq6xxqGYp2WSpL%2BqusY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

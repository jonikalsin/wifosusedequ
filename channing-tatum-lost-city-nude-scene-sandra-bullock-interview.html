The actor opened up about doing the scene “like 50 times” in an upcoming interview on&nbsp;Ellen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Channing admitted that with the movie being so funny, he and Sandra couldn’t help but laugh while working on it. He did say that the naked scene came on one of his first days working on the movie. “We broke all the time,” he said. “That was day two of filming. I basically walked in. You’re like, ‘Hey my name is Channing. I don’t know very many of you yet, but we’re about to get to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>know each other really well.</a>‘”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/channing-tatum-admits-about-sandra-bullock-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Given what a funny movie it was, he revealed that as Sandra was “looking right down the barrel” of his butt, one of his lines was hard to get a good take of, because it was just so funny. He said he had trouble getting “They’re sucking on my butt like a Jamba Juice” down! “When that line came out, we had to do it like 50 times, because I couldn’t do it straight,” the&nbsp;21 Jump Street&nbsp;star said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Towards the end of the interview, Channing admitted that he would want to do a sequel, but he wasn’t sure what would be a good setting for it, joking that he couldn’t do the same scene in a colder climate. “Doing a butt-naked leech scene in the arctic or something is not something I’m going to do. Nope, not feeling confident enough to do that scene again!” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/channing-tatum-about-sandra-bullock-on-ellen-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sandra had also opened up about the scene during a March 14 interview with&nbsp;<strong>Stephen Colbert</strong>. “I had to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spend some time down there</a>,” she said. “Just making sure that no leeches. I had a lot to say to it, apparently. As one does when you’re down there, you might as well get to know it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FtZpygkaO7qrrGZquarKWieq270q1knKGkrnqvwcOeZKyblaOybr%2FAp5urmV2Xwq24zpyiZqGeqbKzwsiermg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

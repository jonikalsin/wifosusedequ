The acting wasn’t Catherine’s first choice. After returning from a modeling stint in Japan, she began acting.</strong></p><p><strong>Bell’s most recent endeavors included production work and performing arts in the Hallmark Good Witch television series and movie franchise. Cassandra “Cassie” Nightingale was played by Catherine for 13 years until the seven-season series came to an end in July 2021.</strong></p><h2>Catherine Bell is busy selling jewelry after The Good Witch&nbsp;ended</h2><p>In her final Instagram post, Catherine Bell referred to The Good Witch’s cast and crew as her “family“.</p><p>According to Bell, complaining about your show being canceled after seven seasons would be impolite, so I won’t. I have had the good fortune to work on numerous long-running shows, but Good Witch was unique.</p><p>Catherine Bell is hard at work on her jewelry line, “Catherine Bell Jewelry,” even though no forthcoming projects have been revealed. Alongside her reported love interest Brooke Daniells, Bell introduced the brand. The two say on the website for their line, “The inspiration for our line is a combination of a love of vintage jewelry items as well as the beauty we find all around us in art, nature, travel, and architecture.”</p><p><strong>“Creating beautiful jewelry items is a way for us to express ourselves and give back to the art world that inspires us continually.”</strong></p><p>Bell forewent demanding acting gigs to spend more time with her kids. Their children, Ronan and Gemma, were born in <strong>August 2010 and April 2003</strong>, respectively, to Catherine and her ex-husband Adam Beason.</p><h2>Catherine Bell gave up intensive acting roles to spend time with her children</h2><p>Catherine shied away from demanding jobs that would take her away from the kids for an extended period after giving birth to them. In a September 2013 interview with Iran Times, she highlighted her affection for Ronan and Gemma:</p><p>More than anything, I adore being a mother. It’s undoubtedly the most enjoyable “work” I’ve ever had. My kids’ names are individually inked on my body. Ronan is written in the Ogham old Celtic alphabet on the inside of my right forearm, while Gemma is written in Persian on my left wrist.</p><p>Bell says on the website for her jewelry brand that Gemma experienced a “heart scare” that was treated by specialists. Catherine and Brooke give a portion of their income to The Miraglo Foundation in honor of medical personnel. Reads the brand’s website:</p><p><strong>Every heart pendant purchase will result in a donation to the Miraglo Foundation, which offers healthcare and grants to the underprivileged, particularly to a group of female cardiologists who treat children in India and the Middle East. This is our way of giving back.</strong></p><p>Gemma has developed into an outstanding young lady who is almost as tall as her mother.</p><p>It’s party time!</p><p>Bell added a caption to a picture of herself and Gemma cuddling in early <strong>October 2020</strong>.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Steven Krueger Girlfriend, Gay, Net Worth</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>NitaChantelle</a></h3>NitaChantelle estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
